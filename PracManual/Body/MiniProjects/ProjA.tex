\section{Mini-Project A}
\label{sec:ProjA}
This project examines ELO5.2, which requires the student to develop a representative embedded system. It requires hardware/software interfacing, so an ADC is sampled by software, and processing operations are applied to read the data. 

\subsection{Pre-Project Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You will need to have completed all the previous practicals in order to complete this project.
    \item Using the design flows presented in class, we strongly recommend beginning by drawing up an initial design and mapping the required tasks to (at the least) a simple timeline or Gantt chart.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Outcomes}
In addition to creating a working system, you will learn about the following in this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ADC - \href{https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/MCP3008.pdf}{MCP3008}
    \item Temperature sensor - \href{http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/20001942g.pdf}{MCP9700A}
    \item IOT - \href{https://blynk.io/}{Blynk}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deliverables}
At the end of this practical, you must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Demonstrate your working implementation to a tutor through a formal presentation. This will take the form of a formal presentation in a 10 minute slot you will book in advance. See Table \ref{tbl:DemoValidation} for details on the demonstration.
    \item Submit your report to Vula, in the format shown in Table \ref{tbl:flamarks}
    \item For information on the marks and what sections to cover, refer to the marking guide in Section \ref{sec:ProjAMarks}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Required}

\begin{multicols}{2}
Figure \ref{fig:blynkexample} shows an example of what the app you create in Blynk might look like.
As you can see there's a terminal for accessing the output of the print statements, three values as read from the ADC, and an indicator to indicate if the alarm has gone off. There are various widgets in Blynk. It's suggested you play with your energy budget to develop the most intuitive design and aesthetically pleasing design possible.

\subsection{Hardware requirements}
You will need to build your design and demonstrate it to the marker.

\subsection{Software requirements}
You need to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set up the RTC. You can use either the Raspberry Pi's supplied kernel driver for an RTC, or you can interface with it as you did in Practical 3.
    \item Create a thread for reading from the ADC. The value read from the temperature sensor needs to be converted to degrees Celsius. See the datasheet (linked above) for the formula.
    \item Create interrupts for all the button functionality (don't forget to debounce your inputs)
    \item Output the correctly calculated voltage over the DAC.
    \item Create an output signal to notify the biology student that there is an issue. You can flash an LED using a PWM signal, you can play audio through the audio jack, or you can buy a buzzer from WhiteLab. 
    \item In the main() loop, print values to the screen as described in Section \ref{sec:ProjDescription}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Description}
\label{sec:ProjDescription}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system should have hard-coded thresholds. When a value read by the device goes over a threshold, an alarm should sound. A button must be pressed to dismiss the alarm.
    \item By default, the system continuously monitors the sensors every 1s using this format:
    \begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    RTC Time & Sys Timer & Humidity  & Temp  & Light & DAC out & Alarm \\ \hline
    10:17:15 & 00:00:00 & 0.5 V &   25 C    & 595 & 0.29V&* \\ \hline
    10:17:20 & 00:00:05 & 1.5 V &   25 C    & 595 & 0.87V&* \\ \hline
    10:17:25 & 00:00:10 & 1.7 V &   25 C    & 595 & 0.98V&  \\ \hline
    10:17:30 & 00:00:15 & 2.2 V &   25 C    & 782 & 1.68V&  \\ \hline
    10:17:35 & 00:00:20 & 3.3 V &   25 C    & 998 & 3.22V&  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    Notice how the alarm flag is still active at 10:17:20, as it is only dismissed before the reading at 10:17:25. Also note that even though the DAC out value exceeds the alarm threshold at time 10:17:35, no alarm is sounded as the last alarm was sounded less than three minutes prior. 
    \item The reset switch resets the system timer and cleans the console
    \item The frequency switch changes the frequency of the monitoring. The possible frequencies are 1s, 2s and 5s. The frequency must loop between those values per event occurrence.
    \item The stop switch stops or starts the monitoring of the sensors. The system timer is not affected by this functionality.
    \item Blynk must be used to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item View live logging information (System time and ADC values)
        \item Be notified of alarms
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
