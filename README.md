# EEE3096S
Practical content for EEE3096S Embedded Systems II Course at the University of Cape Town

## Prac 0
Practical 0 covers all the set up and familiarization you need to do in order to become comfortable working with the Raspberry Pi.

## Prac 1
The first practical will get you comfortable interfacing with the Raspberry Pi and GPIO basics, as well as exposure to git.

## Prac 2
Practical 2 serves as an introduction to programming in C. This is done through comparing C and python in the form of a scientific investigation.

## Prac 3
Practical 3 will introduce SPI and threading, in order to play some sampled audio on a DAC.

## Prac 4
The fourth practical introduces I2C and PWM, as well as some more usefule Raspberry Pi concepts. In this practical, you will be making a binary clock that runs as soon as the Raspberry Pi boots.

## Prac 5
Practical 5 isn't directly related to the Raspberrry Pi, but introduces low level knowledge of processors by requiring you to design an ALU.
